Dirtbags Netshovel Library
==========================

This is a library for advanced
[network archaeology](https://sites.google.com/view/cyberfire/foundry/classes/network-archaeology).

It provides a field-tested framework for
exploring unknown TCP-based protocols,
and room to grow these explorations into full-blown decoders.


Get going
=========

Package documentation at
https://godoc.org/github.com/dirtbags/netshovel

We recommend you
copy `examples/simple/simple.go`,
change the `Simple` structs into your own protocol,
and build it up into whatever you want.



The Future
==========

This is my first real Go program,
so it is likely to change drastically
as I figure out how to better architect Go libraries.

We strongly encourage you to bring in whatever version of this you're using
under a [vendor folder](https://blog.gopheracademy.com/advent-2015/vendor-folder/)
and check it in.
